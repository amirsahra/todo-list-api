## Todo list 

This project is a todo list with Laravel framework created with api. You can use this source as a sample code or a real project.

In this project, there are two types of users, admin and member. After registration, the user must confirm his email in order to enter his account.

Each user can create tasks with their own categories. Before reaching the time set for the task, an email will be sent to the user to inform them of the task and its execution time.
Tasks can be edited and the time set for the task should not be less than the value set in the settings.

By default, every user is a member type after registration, and only the admin user can be created by default, as the admin user is created by running the seeder command.
We will explain more about this later.
